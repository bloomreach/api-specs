        The <b>Product Search API</b> sends a keyword query to retrieve results about products and other content on your site. You can apply additional filters and facets to return products and content that either include or exclude specified attributes like colors and brands.
        The <b>Category Search API</b> sends a category query to retrieve results about products within the categories that you specify.
