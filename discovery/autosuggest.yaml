            A list of catalog views that you want to see in your suggestions.
            You must specify the catalog name within the catalog view. For
            Product catalogs, the catalog name is the same value as your
            domain_key. <br><br> A **catalog_views** value contains the view_ids
            within a catalog separated by a colon. If you pass multiple catalogs
            in **catalog_views**, they must be pipe-separated. Attributes
            suggestions are enabled for the first two catalogs mentioned as part
            of catalog_views and only for the first view passed in each of the
            first two catalogs. <br><br> For example,
            **&catalog_views=product:store1,store2|recipe:premium|articles**
            would return text and attribute suggestions for the product catalog
            in the store1 view, and for the recipe catalog in the premium view;
            only text suggestions will be displayed for the articles catalog.

            <br><br> Bloomreach doesn't automatically enforce the requirements
            for this parameter. For example, you can enter test as your value
            for each instance of the request_id parameter without triggering an
            error message. However, using a unique value allows us to help you
            if you encounter a problem.

            The user agent of the browser that's making the search request.
            <br><br> Make sure that this value in your API request is the same
            as the value in the original request from your user. We optimize
            pages in part by crawling and gathering data, and the original
            user_agent lets us distinguish between our internal Bloomreach users
            who QA pages and everyone else who visits your site.

            The universal customer ID of the user. You only need to pass this
            field if your particular integration tracks customers this way.  The
            parameter captures user IDs from the customer side, and reuses the
            information when powering apps or enhancing cross-device linking. In
            this way, Bloomreach recognizes users in a way that's aligned with
            your system. <br><br> Use an anonymous string. Don't use email or
            other personally identifiable information. <br><br> If you do not
            track users this way, then omit this field.
